# How to Use GitHub Issue Creator

Follow these simple steps to generate and post issues to any public GitHub repository.

## 1. Enter Repository URL
*   Navigate to the main page of the application.
*   Copy the URL of the GitHub repository you want to contribute to (e.g., `https://github.com/facebook/react`).
*   Paste it into the main search bar.

## 2. (Optional) Configure Advanced Options
Click on the **Advanced Options** dropdown to fine-tune the results:
*   **Project Goals:** Type specific instructions for the AI.
    *   *Example:* "Focus on improving the mobile responsiveness of the CSS."
    *   *Example:* "Find security vulnerabilities in the authentication flow."
*   **Scan for TODOs:** Toggle this **ON** if you want the AI to search the codebase for `TODO` comments and turn them into issues.

## 3. Generate Issues
*   Click the green **Generate** button.
*   Wait a few seconds while the AI analyzes the repository and searches for context.

## 4. Review Suggestions
*   The app will present 3 distinct issue cards (Bug, Feature, etc.).
*   Click **View Content** on any card to see the full Markdown body.
*   Read the **Reasoning** to understand why this issue was suggested.

## 5. Create the Issue
*   Select the suggestion you like best.
*   Click the **Create Issue** button.
*   A new tab will open on GitHub with the Title, Body, and Labels pre-filled.
*   Review the text one last time on GitHub and click **Submit new issue**.
